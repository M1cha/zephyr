        description: |
          An array of pins sharing the same group properties. The pins should
          be defined using pre-defined macros or, alternatively, using the
          HC32_PINMUX utility macro.

      drive-strength:
        type: string
        enum:
          - "high"
          - "low"
        default: "high"
        description: |
          The drive strength of a pin, relative to full-driver strength.
          The default value is "high", which is the reset value.

      analog-mode:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Set the pin to analog mode.
